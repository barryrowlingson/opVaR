Description: opVaR package computes operational risk by Monte Carlo
        simulation performed by \code{\link{mc}} function. It provides
        reading losses, merges them by chosen periods, fits frequency
        and severity distributions. Finally, VaR is computed basing on
        simulated yearly losses.
